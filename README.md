## CMScrape is now ARCHIVED
To get similar results, in a more up to date software, use [AutoScrape](https://github.com/DrankRock/AutoScrape) with the **cardmarket_parser** plugin. 

If you're a dev, comfortable with python and js, feel free to fork Autoscrape, make it yourself and improve it, as my time and motivation are lacking for scraping softwares.
